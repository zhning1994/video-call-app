## Purpose of Project

I noticed that people in React community talk about Next.js, and I have seen many Tech YouTuber talk about it. Next.Js has been praised about its faster development advantage, SEO-friendly as Next.js using SSR(server-side rendering), image optimization, etc. 

So I would like have to try to build an E-commerce project using Next.js, therefore I can explore more about this framework. Besides that, I am keen to know how an E-commerce web would be setup in real world, from frontend customer interacting page, admin pages to allow admin customize the product and seing report of sales, to serverside and database setup.

By doing this project, its not only enchance my knowledge of Next.js, React.js. Web apps authentication can be very confused, with the help of NextAuth.js,saving token, let user stay login, all the issue has been solved. Paypal paying method is used in this project. Payment method setting could be complicated, but successfully setup in the end.

Build another Next.js E-commerce apps again would be my next step, and setup the paying method using Stripe together with Paypal, different UI design would be tried.
