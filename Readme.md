## Purpose of Project

There has been a surge in video call apps since the Covid-19 pandamic period , when social distancing and work from home become a norm. Video call apps become the best tool to interact with friends and family without physically contact. There are some apps like Zoom, Google Meet, WhatsApp, Messenger has been used drastically. I am keen to try build a video call apps which I can customize the layout, add on some fancy features. It would be nice and convenience to have a video call apps that suit our own needs. 

I do searching on Google, Youtube, find out that **Agora.io** is a good platform to create video call app, and most importantly, JavaScript and React.js go together with Agora. Setup of app can be complicated , I need more time to figure it out, and the version of Agora is changing, some method or features has been deprecated.

This app has room of improvement, I need to spend more time on documentation and look for help of some guru on YouTube. Overall, it a good experience of doing video call apps with Agora.io.
